# TODO

- Animated Text/Paragraph (as a system with a dialog component that holds all the original text)
- Polygon colliders (somehow I havent added this yet) + Polygon renderers
- Stroked versions of all the render components.
- UI Elements (Input.mouseX,Y,Input.mouseDown,Input.mouseUp)
    - Example: Button
        - Components: Color, HoverColor, DisabledColor
        - System(s): buttonSystem
- Sprite Sheet Support
    - SpriteSheet component
    - spriteSheetRenderSystem that updates Sprite based on SpriteSheet
    - Obviously animations will work fine with this
- Directional colliders (collide from only up not down etc.)
- Constraints (like axels, and stuff rubber bands that hold stuff together)
- Make the game engine fun to use and append features!

## FAR FUTURE

- WEBGL instead of 2D Canvas
- WASM: probably Rust
